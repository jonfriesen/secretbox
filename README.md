# secret box
This is a wrapper using the [crypto/nacl/secretbox](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox) library as a easy to use symmetric encryption to string format with everything you need to decrypt.

The structure of `/crypto` is inspired by the [Shopify/ejson crypto wrapper](https://github.com/Shopify/ejson/tree/master/crypto).
